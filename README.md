# discord-botbase-python
A base for Discord Bots made in Python
# JSON File Template
For this bot to work correctly you will need a file in the directory of the bot called `config.json`. Fortunately, this is easy to make!
```json
{
    "token": "Desired Token Goes Here",
    "prefix": "!, or whatever you want it to be!"
}
```
